This project is a time capsule of hobbies I took up during the COVID-19 pandemic. It includes a list of the hobbies with short descriptions and pictures, where applicable. The project was designed to serve as a portfolio piece for Code Louisville's January 2021 Front End Web Development class.

The features included to meet the Code Louisville project requirements are the following:

1. CSS Features List: A navigation menu that expands and collapses at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal, or is opened by clicking the "hamburger" menu item.

The navigation menu changes depending on screen size. On smaller screens, clicking the hamburger menu icon opens and displays the menu vertically. On larger screens (1200px+), the hamburger menu is replaced by a horizontal navbar.


2. JavaScript Features List: Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction. 

In addition to the hamburger menu described above, which opens and closes when you click the corresponding icon, the to do list near the bottom of the page can be shown/hidden by clicking the button beneath it. 

The to do list itself displays text typed into the input field on the page when you click the + button. List items can be crossed out by clicking once on that item and then deleted by double-clicking.


3. CSS Features List: Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. 

This page uses Flexbox to switch between single/multi column layouts for the photos, depending on screen size (1000px+).
