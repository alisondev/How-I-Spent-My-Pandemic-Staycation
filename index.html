            <p>One Year of Lockdown: A Time Capsule</p>
        </div>
    </header>

        <main>
            <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Traveling is one of my favorite hobbies. I love exploring new places, meeting new people, and trying new things, but also the prep involved beforehand: choosing the location, doing the research, planning the itinerary, etc. In the "before times," prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, I almost always had at least one upcoming trip on the calendar. Something exciting ahead.</p>
            <p>Like most everything else, that changed in March 2020. Starting with the first wave of lockdowns, I had to find something else to do with all that time and energy. Somewhere along the way, it occurred to me that I might look back (from the distant, hopefully COVID-free future) and wonder what on earth I did with that lost year.</p>
            <p>This project was the result. It's a time capsule of new activities I took up in 2020-21, or rediscovered. The site itself was created for a Code Louisville class&mdash;another new journey of sorts.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2 id="working">Working from Home</h2>
            <p>(Let's pretend this counts as a hobby.) I was fortunate to have a job that could be done remotely. I did <i>not</i> have a home office, nor anywhere to put one, which presented some challenges. This photo shows my couch-workstation. My canine coworker decides when it's break time.</p>

            <h2 id="strike">Eating</h2>
            <h2 class="poststrike" id="cooking">Cooking</h2>
            <p>I never enjoyed this until suddenly I had no office and no commute. That created space at the end of the day for cooking. Makes for a nice transition from work life to home life. Also, there's food when you're done.</p>

            <h2 id="hiking">Hiking</h2>
            <p>This was the one no-travel exception: socially distanced, outdoor day trips to Bernheim, the Falls of the Ohio, and the Kentucky River. Nature has never looked so good.</p>

            <h2 id="gardening">Windowsill Gardening</h2>
            <p>I had no outdoor space to jump on the gardening bandwagon. I did have plenty of windows, all facing exactly the wrong direction. These were fun while the sun lasted.</p>

            <h2 id="photos">Organizing Photos</h2>
            <p>Konmari is very well-adapted to being locked in your house for a year. I totally reorganized my photo storage and printed and framed a lot of past travel photos. These are from my last real vacation: a long weekend in New Orleans back in January 2020. Beign-YAYS!</p>

            <h2 id="pc">PC Building</h2>
            <p>I completed my second PC build, six years after the first one. GPU prices did NOT cooperate. Parts in general were scarce and overpriced. This did provide something to research, namely half a dozen stock tracking Discord channels and some creative substitutions.</p>

            <h2 id="js">Learning JavaScript</h2>
            <p>I had some previous experience with HTML and CSS, but not JavaScript. Here's a to do list I made after several hours on Google/YouTube, looking for something even simpler than "beginner."</p>

                    <li>Click any task to mark it complete.</li>
                    <li>Double click any task to delete it.</li>
